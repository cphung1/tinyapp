# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Users need to create an account and be logged in to create shortened URLs. Their accounts will store a list of the URLs they have shortened. Users are also able to edit and delete the URLs. One does not need an account to access these shortened URL links though.
